I am now working as an Assistant Professor, at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

I received my bachelor and Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2016 and 2021, respectively. 

My research interests include computational theory, design, and analysis of algorithms for big data, and database technologies for AI. My current research focus is on vector similrity search.
